                    <p><strong>The F12berlinetta not only ushers in a whole new generation of prancing horse 12-cylinders but is also the most powerful & high performance ferrari of the range product. The F12berlinetta’s 200-bar, direct-injection 6262 cc 65° v12 delivers absolutely unprecedented performance for a naturally aspirated 12-cylinder engine in terms of both power and revs.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>It has a maximum power output of 740 CV at 8250 rpm, while its specific power output is 118 CV/l, a record for this kind of engine. Responsiveness and strong pick-up are assured by maximum torque of 690 Nm, 80 per cent of which is already on tap at 2500 rpm. Exceptional strides have also been made with regard to fuel consumption and emissions both of which have been slashed by 30% to 15l/100 km and 350 g/km of CO2, making the F12berlinetta a benchmark for its reference segment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ferrari reveals the f12tdf which pays homage to the tour de france, the legendary endurance road race that ferrari dominated in the 1950s and 60s, particularly with the 1956 250 gt berlinetta which won four consecutive editions. It was a race that rewarded cars that combined maximum performance with the driveability and ease of use that enabled the competitors to race for hundreds of kilometres a day over fast, tortuous roads and on circuits.</strong> </p>
                    <p>The F12tdf’s performance is assured by the 780 cv, naturally-aspirated V12 derived directly from the F12berlinetta’s multi-award-winning engine. The car’s exhilarating dynamic behavior, specifically its lateral acceleration in corners, is due to an 8% increase in the ratio of the front tires compared to the rear ones.
The car’s natural tendency to over steer as a result of the change in tire sizes is compensated for by the innovative rear-wheel steering system – known as the Virtual Short Wheelbase, which is integrated with the other vehicle dynamic control systems – that guarantees the steering wheel response times and turn-in of a competition car while increasing stability at high speed.

                    <p><strong>The Ferrari 488 spider is the latest chapter in maranello’s ongoing history of open-top v8 sports cars, a story that started with the targa-top version of the 308 gtb - the immortal 308 gts - and which ultimately resulted in the full convertible spider architecture.
Starting with the rht (retractable hard top) around which the entire car was developed, every area of the 488 spider has been designed to set new technological benchmarks for the sector.</strong></p>
<p>The result is the most powerful and innovative Ferrari Spider ever built, a car that marries the extraordinary prowess of the 488 GTB coupé’s mid-rear V8 with the joy of tackling even the most challenging roads surrounded by nature’s heady aromas and colors and accompanied by an inimitable Ferrari engine soundtrack. At the very heart of the car is, of course, the 3902cc turbo-charged V8 which set a new benchmark for this type of architecture. Thanks to a maximum power output of 670 CV and smooth, progressive torque delivery in the higher gears by the Variable Torque Management system, the 488 Spider sprints from 0 to 100 km/h in 3 seconds flat and from 0 to 200 km/h in 8.7 seconds.</p>
